# more
This site is a tool that calculates the length of the script* in WPM, REST, and SKIPS.

You can change the initial WPM in the settings.

WPM markers, or words-per-minute, ::[wpm=...] control the pacing of the script. The more, the merrier.
REST markers, measured in seconds, ::[rest=...] add interval pauses between lines.
SKIP markers, ::[skip=start/finish] skips certain parts of text. These excludes words from being included in the calculation.

[🎚️ + WPM] or (Ctrl+Enter) to set a new WPM, [🌃 + REST] or (Alt+Enter) to add a rest interval, [⏩ + SKIP] or (Shift+Enter) to add a skip.

You can IMPORT any text file, and it'll calculate the reading time (from the initial WPM).
You can also EXPORT the file as a .txt or its CALC logs to see its calculating process, either as a .txt or .csv file.

*This is only just an approximation using simple calculations. Actual length of your script will vary in real speech.
